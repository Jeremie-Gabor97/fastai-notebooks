Colab notebook to create sports classifier

Used fastai (library on top of pytorch) to train a neural network with the dataset provided by 
Li-Jia Li and Li Fei-Fei as part of their paper What, where and who? Classifying event by scene and
object recognition . IEEE Intern. Conf. in Computer Vision (ICCV). 2007.
The dataset contains images of 8 sports event categories: rock climbing, badminton, bocce, croquet, polo,
rowing, sailing and snowboarding.
